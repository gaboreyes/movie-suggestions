TODO:
build a Least Recently Used data structure for movies
suggest movies using the LRU
only admins can see the full users

----------

I wanted to implement a LRU, a common use case for this I figure would be recommending
something based on the most recently used element. Thats why I figure a movie recommendation
service was a good fit.

Database will be the default sqlite from django due to this not being focused on the DB aspec of things

LRU design explanation:
The LRU has a head and a tail representing the start and the end of the queue.
The LRU is a hashmap populated with <keys> being movie ids.
And the <values> are objects from a double linked list with nodes.

These nodes represent movies from the database.
Each node has a pointer to the next most recent movie in the LRU
And a pointer the previously recent movie before this node's insertion
The overall most recent movie has the head of the LRU as next node
The overall oldest movie has the tail of the LRU as previos node
